CORE 
	Interpretation: Interpretation semantics for this word are undefined.
	Compilation: ( C: -- orig )
Put the location of a new unresolved forward reference orig onto the control flow stack. Append the run-time semantics given below to the current definition. The semantics are incomplete until orig is resolved, e.g., by THEN or ELSE.

	Run-time: ( x -- )
If all bits of x are zero, continue execution at the location specified by the resolution of orig.
